Kouler
======

A game prototype written in [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/), and a first attempt at recreating
Jan Hubicka's classic Linux game [Koules](http://www.ucw.cz/~hubicka/koules/English/koules.html).

So far I've got an inertially damped player sprite. The next step will be
to create some targets (precursor to enemies) that I can knock off the screen.
