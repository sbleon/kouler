Kouler
======

A game prototype written in Ruby and [Gosu](http://www.libgosu.org/) and a first attempt at recreating
Jan Hubicka's classic Linux game [Koules](http://www.ucw.cz/~hubicka/koules/English/koules.html).

So far I've got:

- a damped player sprite
- collision detection

The next steps will be:

- enemies that actually move
- proper elastic collisions
